# ðŸ¦€ Rust Task Manager

##  This project is guided by the **Microsoft Reactor program** and aims to create a tool that allows users to **add, list, and complete tasks**. All task information is stored in a **JSON file**, ensuring data persists between program executions.  

---

## Project Description
The project is a **lightweight command-line application** that manages a to-do list stored in a local file.  

It offers three core functionalities:
- **Add a Task** â†’ Create a new task with a description. Each task gets a timestamp when created.  
- **List Tasks** â†’ Display all stored tasks with their creation time in a human-friendly format.  
- **Complete a Task** â†’ Remove a task from the list once itâ€™s finished.  

Each task is represented by a `Task` struct containing:
- `text` â†’ A string describing the task  
- `created_at` â†’ A timestamp of when the task was created (stored in UTC and displayed in the userâ€™s local timezone).  

---

##  System Architecture
The system follows a **modular architecture** with clear responsibilities:  

### `main.rs`
- Program entry point  
- Receives parsed CLI arguments from the `cli` module  
- Chooses the correct action (`Add`, `List`, `Done`)  
- Delegates execution to the `tasks` module  

### `cli.rs`
Defines the **command-line interface** using the `structopt` library.  

Examples:
```bash
cargo run -- -j journal.json add "Buy milk"
cargo run -- -j journal.json list
cargo run -- -j journal.json done 1

### tasks.rs

Contains the core business logic:

Defines the Task struct

Implements add, list, and done functions

Handles serialization (save tasks to JSON) and deserialization (load tasks from JSON)

### journal.json

Stores the userâ€™s task list in JSON format, ensuring data persistence.

---
## Libraries and Core Concepts

The project combines three key Rust libraries:

structopt â†’ Simplifies parsing command-line arguments.

serde + serde_json â†’ For serialization & deserialization of tasks into JSON.

chrono â†’ For handling dates & timestamps.
---

## Core Functions

Add Task â†’ Reads tasks from JSON, appends new task, saves updated list.

List Tasks â†’ Reads all tasks and displays them with local timezone formatting.

Complete Task â†’ Removes a task by index and updates the JSON file.

### Custom Display

The project implements the fmt::Display trait for clean output formatting.

This produces nice, readable output : Buy milk                                           [2025-09-14 21:00]
Instead of the raw struct: Task { text: "Buy milk", created_at: 2025-09-14T20:00:00Z }

## Traits in Rust

A trait in Rust is similar to an interface in Java or an abstract class in C++.
It defines a contract of methods a type must implement, without specifying how.

In this project:

fmt::Display is used to control how Task is formatted into a human-readable string.

This enables clean, customizable console output for each task.
